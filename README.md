# Nashorn Sandbox

A sandbox for executing JavaScript in Java apps using the [Nashorn](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/nashorn/) engine.

Also see [Graal JS Sandbox](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-graaljs-sandbox) and [Rhino Sandbox](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-rhino-sandbox).

Part of the [Java Delight Suite](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-main#java-delight-suite).

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox.svg)](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cdelight-nashorn-sandbox)

Note: Use version 0.3.x if you are using a Java version older than Java 20.

## Usage

The sandbox by default **blocks access to all** Java classes.

Classes, which should be used in JavaScript, must be explicitly allowed.

```java
NashornSandbox sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();
     
sandbox.allow(File.class);
     
sandbox.eval("var File = Java.type('java.io.File'); File;")
```

Or you can inject your Java object as a JS global variable

```java
NashornSandbox sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();

sandbox.inject("fromJava", new Object());

sandbox.eval("fromJava.getClass();");
```

The sandbox also allows limiting the CPU time and memory usage of scripts. This allows terminating scripts which contain infinite loops and other problematic code.

```java
NashornSandbox sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();
     
sandbox.setMaxCPUTime(100);
sandbox.setMaxMemory(50*1024);
sandbox.setMaxPreparedStatements(30); // because preparing scripts for execution is expensive
sandbox.setExecutor(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor());
     
sandbox.eval("var o={}, i=0; while (true) {o[i++]='abc';};");
```

This code will raise a ScriptCPUAbuseException.

The sandbox beautifies the JavaScript code for this and injects additional statements into the submitted code. It is thus possible that the original line numbers from
the submitted JS code are not preserved. To debug the code, which is generated by the sandbox, activate its debug mode as follows using a `log4j.properties` file (see [log4j.properties](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox/blob/master/src/test/resources/log4j.properties)):

```
log4j.logger.delight.nashornsandbox.NashornSandbox=DEBUG
```

This will output the generated JS on the console as follows:

```
--- Running JS ---
var \__it = Java.type('delight.nashornsandbox.internal.InterruptTest');var \__if=function(){\__it.test();};
while(true) {__if();
  i = i+1;
}
--- JS END ---
```

The sandbox also allows precompiling frequently used scripts. Using a precompiled script can substantially increase execution times.

```java
NashornSandbox sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();
CompiledScript script = sandbox.compile("1 + 1");
int result1 = (int) sandbox.eval(script);
int result2 = (int) sandbox.eval(script);
```

## Maven

Just add the following dependency to your projects.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.javadelight</groupId>
    <artifactId>delight-nashorn-sandbox</artifactId>
    <version>[insert latest version]</version>
</dependency>
```

Note that up to version v.0.1.31 the library would only work with Java versions lower than 13. To make the library work with Java version 13 and above, please use a library version 0.2.0+. The compatibility with v0.2.0 with lower versions of Java is still experimental. If you encounter issues, specifically in Java 1.8 please use a 0.1.x version (and please report any issues).
