# Nashorn Sandbox

A secure sandbox for executing JavaScript in Java apps using the [Nashorn](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/nashorn/) engine.

Initial support for Graal JS is also provided (see [PR #87](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox/pull/87/)). Please note that this support is experimental and the API for Graal JS access may change.

Also see [Rhino Sandbox](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-rhino-sandbox).

Part of the [Java Delight Suite](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-main#java-delight-suite).

Open Security Issues: [# 73](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox/issues/73)

## Usage

The sandbox by default **blocks access to all** Java classes.

Classes, which should be used in JavaScript, must be explicitly allowed.

```java
NashornSandbox sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();
     
sandbox.allow(File.class);
     
sandbox.eval("var File = Java.type('java.io.File'); File;")
```

Or you can inject your java object as a JS global variable

```java
NashornSandboxes sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();

sandbox.inject("fromJava", new Object());

sandbox.eval("fromJava.getClass();");
```

The sandbox also allows limiting the CPU time and memory usage of scripts. This allows terminating scripts which contain infinite loops and other problematic code.

```java
NashornSandbox sandbox = NashornSandboxes.create();
     
sandbox.setMaxCPUTime(100);
sandbox.setMaxMemory(50*1024);
sandbox.allowNoBraces(false);
sandbox.setMaxPreparedStatements(30); // because preparing scripts for execution is expensive
sandbox.setExecutor(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor());
     
sandbox.eval("var o={}, i=0; while (true) {o[i++]='abc';};");
```

This code will raise a ScriptCPUAbuseException.

The sandbox beautifies the JavaScript code for this and injects additional statements into the submitted code. It is thus possible that the original line numbers from
the submitted JS code are not preserved. To debug the code, which is generated by the sandbox, activate its debug mode as follows using log4j.properties file:

```
log4j.logger.delight.nashornsandbox.internal.NashornSandboxImpl=DEBUG
```

This will output the generated JS on the console as follows:

```
--- Running JS ---
var \__it = Java.type('delight.nashornsandbox.internal.InterruptTest');var \__if=function(){\__it.test();};
while(true) {__if();
  i = i+1;
}
--- JS END ---
```
